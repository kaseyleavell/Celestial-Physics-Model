# Celestial-Physics-Model
Kinematic Equation based Physics model

This model currently ustilizes 3 of the attached files. Those three are Mass.h, Main.cpp and Screen.h. The File reader file isn't fully implimented yet but will add functionality to 
the program that will make use a lot easier.

Planet.h and star.h are place holders

A majority of the calculations I do occur in Mass.h.
